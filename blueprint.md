*   **Data:** JSON (`products.json`)

### Key Features

    *   **Hero Section:** A large, visually appealing hero section with a headline, subtitle, and a "Discover Collection" call-to-action button.
    *   **Featured Collections:** A grid of four featured collection banners (Diwali, Halloween, Christmas, New Year) that link to their respective category pages.
*   **Category Pages (`category.html`):
    *   **Dynamic Loading:** Product data is loaded dynamically from `products.json` based on the category specified in the URL.

## Completed Tasks

### Cache-Busting for Product Data

*   **Problem:** The browser was caching the old `products.json` file, causing outdated product information to be displayed even after the file was updated.
*   **Solution:** Implemented a cache-busting mechanism by appending a unique timestamp (`?v=${new Date().getTime()}`) to the `fetch` requests in `category.html` and `product.html`. This forces the browser to download the latest version of the `products.json` file every time a page is loaded, ensuring the most current product data is displayed.

### Update All Collections

*   **Updated `products.json`:** The `products.json` file has been updated with the new product names, descriptions, and prices for the Christmas 2025, Halloween 2025, and New Year 2026 collections.
*   **Standardized Data:** The `stock` field has been removed from the `products.json` file for all products to standardize the data structure.
*   **Updated Category Page (`category.html`):** The category page has been updated to remove the display of the `stock` information, aligning the front end with the new data structure.
*   **Updated Product Page (`product.html`):** The product page has been updated to remove the display of the `stock` information, aligning the front end with the new data structure.

### Update Diwali Collection and Redesign

*   **Updated `products.json`:** The `products.json` file has been updated with the new product names, descriptions, and prices for the Diwali 2025 collection. Descriptions have been added for all other products to ensure data consistency.
*   **Redesigned Category Page (`category.html`):**
    *   The product grid now includes product descriptions.
    *   The overall design has been enhanced with a more luxurious feel, including a refined color palette, improved typography, and more elegant spacing.
    *   The page is now fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
*   **Redesigned Product Page (`product.html`):**
    *   The product page now displays the product description.
    *   The layout has been improved to better showcase the product and its details.
    *   The page is now fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
*   **Updated Homepage (`index.html`):**
